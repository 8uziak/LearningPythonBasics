### Description

This folder is dedicated to the completed tasks that can be found on PracticePython [link](https://www.practicepython.org). The markings in brackets () as well as the titles of my projects are a perfect reflection of what is on the website. 

### Project worth checking

The best project in this depository is definitely the hanging ([POJECT: Hangman](https://github.com/8uziak/LearningPythonBasics/blob/main/030.%20Hangman%20Game%20(exercises%20030%2C%20031%2C%20032)%20.ipynb)) . The project has a proper visual layer, it checks the number of negative answers on the fly, it shows the guessed letters in the right places of the guessed word, the word library is over 26 thousand words, which is imported from a separate .txt file. I encourage you to check out the project.
